Welcome to the InfoOps! This is a dedicated space for cybersecurity professionals, enthusiasts, and learners to collaborate, improve their skills, and compete in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions. We focus on utilizing platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and others to challenge ourselves and grow as a team.

📜 Our Mission
Our mission is to bring together a group of motivated and skilled individuals who are passionate about cybersecurity. We aim to:
- Collaborate on cybersecurity challenges and real-world scenarios.
- Compete in CTFs across various platforms to sharpen our skills.
- Build a strong team that grows together through knowledge sharing and problem-solving.
- Expand into offering Penetration Testing services to companies as we develop and refine our skills.

🎯 Our Goals
1. Build a Competitive Team: We aim to dominate in CTF competitions, representing our community as a top-tier group of cybersecurity experts.
2. Develop Skills Together: Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned professional, we believe in learning and growing through hands-on challenges.
3. Create Real-World Opportunities: As we grow, we plan to offer penetration testing services to companies, turning our expertise into practical business solutions.

🔧 What We Do
- CTF Competitions: Regularly participate in and organize Capture the Flag challenges.
- Knowledge Sharing: Learn together by solving boxes on platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and more.
- Community Events: We host events to deepen our cybersecurity skills, from focused study sessions to informal hacking hangouts.

📢 Expectations
We are only looking for engaged, active members who are truly passionate about cybersecurity. Here’s what we expect from everyone:
- Active Participation: Join CTFs, work on challenges, and collaborate with fellow members.
- Contribution to the Community: Host or attend events, share knowledge, and help grow the community.
- Engagement, Not Presence: We need people who are engaged, not just present. Members who are inactive without reason will be removed.
- Communication is Key: We understand emergencies happen, and if you need to step away, just let us know. If you remain inactive without explanation, rejoining later won’t be possible.

If you're passionate about cybersecurity, want to grow with a team, and are ready to contribute, this is the place for you. Let’s push the boundaries of our skills, compete, and build a community that thrives on knowledge, collaboration, and success.
